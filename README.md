# CRUD APP
- I'm currently learning RUST and so building a little CRUD app to get my feet wet
- A big goal with this project is just to get things up and running and not immediately worry about doing things "right"
- Though I will be periodically refactoring this codebase to do things more idiomatically and to better understand Rust best practices rather than just hacking stuff until it works
