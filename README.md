# CRUD APP
- I'm currently learning RUST and so building a little CRUD app to get my feet wet
- A big goal with this project is just to get things up and running and not immediately worry about doing things "right"
- Though I will be periodically refactoring this codebase to do things more idiomatically and to better understand Rust best practices rather than just hacking stuff until it works


## Update: Current state as of 09/03/2024
- This project kind of evolved into a service that allows you to add/remove movies from your backlog and also connects up to the tmdb database to retrieve data about them. There are quite a few more things I might do with the project if the motivation strikes, but I don't really plan on touching it for a bit. Some things that would be nice are:
  - Ability to mark things as "watched"
  - More details retrieved about each movie in search results
  - Unit testing
  - Handling more errors (there are still a lot of unwraps all over the place)
 
## Reflections:
- I had a lot of fun with this and feel like I learned a lot about Rust, this project incorporates features such as:
  - Asynchronous programming
  - Concurrency
  - Database Access
  - Third Party API Requests
 
and it was really great to get an experience doing a wide range of stuff with a new language to get my feet wet!
